            <p>
              Since childhood, I have always been fascinated with systems. It started with languages and games, and
              extended to psychology, economics and philosophy. When playing around with a new system, I aim to
              understand it as deeply as possible, then optimize and improve it. I myself am no exception to this rule.
              I love to "upgrade" myself by learning new mindsets and ways of doing things every day.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a programmer, I do my job the same way I do everything else â€” always aiming for optimization. I like
              learning new technologies. I also strive to deliver the highest quality code, paying special attention to
              details. I may not be the fastest coder, but I am the cleanest. I take pride in the fact, that my code is
              easy to understand, maintain and extend at low cost to the business (and yes, I am interested in business
              topics as well). I don't only code for today, but for tomorrow as well.

              educational) projects I did.
